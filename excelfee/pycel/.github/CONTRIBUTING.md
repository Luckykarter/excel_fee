### Contributing to Pycel

Thank you for considering contributing to Pycel\!

Whether you are a novice or experienced software developer, all contributions and suggestions are welcome.

### Couple of things we ask before opening a Github Issue or Pull Request

#### Have a Support Question?

* Github is not the best support forum. If you have a support question, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pycel?sort=linked) is likely preferable to using the issue tracker.
* Please note that [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pycel?sort=linked) expects questions about non-working code to include a [minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).


#### Reporting a bug?

* Please tell us:
  * What you expected to happen.
  * What actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an exception.
  * If possible, include a [minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) to help us identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
  * Which version of Pycel you're using.
  * Which version of Python you're using.
  * Which OS you are using.
  * How to reproduce the bug. Bugs with a failing test in a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) get fixed much quicker. Some bugs may never be fixed.

* Want to paste some code or output into the issue? Put \`\`\` on a line above and below your code/output. See [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)'s *Fenced Code Blocks* for details.


#### Suggesting a feature?

* Do you have an idea for a new feature?
  - Fantastic!
  - We would love to hear about it, and may consider implementing it.
  - But please don't **expect** it to be implemented unless you or someone else sends a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 


#### Submitting a Patch or Feature?

* Let us know what you plan in the [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/dgorissen/pycel/issues) so we can provide feedback.
* We love [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). But if you don't have any tests to go with it, it is much less likely to be merged.
* When fixing a bug, please explain clearly under which circumstances the bug happens. Also please provide a failing test case that your patch solves, and make sure the test fails without your patch.
* The [pytest]( http://pytest.org/latest/) unit tests use [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) and will fail if certain aspects of [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) are not followed.
* The [CI tests](https://travis-ci.com) use [tox](http://testrun.org/tox/latest/) and can fail if you have not tested in all supported versions.  
* Open a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/dgorissen/pycel/pulls) with your patches and we will review your contribution and respond as quickly as possible. Please keep in mind that this is an open source project, and it may take us some time to get back to you. Your patience is very much appreciated.
